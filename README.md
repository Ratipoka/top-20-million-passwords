# top_20million_password
This is a list of the top 20 million most used password. It has been made by cracking passwords in the password list available here : https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords. (I've used the ordered by hash ntlm version) The passwords are ordered by frequency.
I've been able to crack 98.45% of the top 20 000 000 passwords. The passwords which have not been cracked are not displayed in the wordlist. The reason why there are fewer than expected passwords in the file is because there are passwords which are similar but don't use the same endoding. I've dedoubled the file to be sure they display only once.
